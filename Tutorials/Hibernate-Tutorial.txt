* hibernate.cfg.xml property show_sql=true gives all the sql used for ddl and dml by hibernate at console.
* hibernate.cfg.xml property hbm2ddl.auto propeerty should be set to "update". When its set to "create" each time hibernate hits connects to database it 
  re-creates the entire db, deleteing any previous existing records.
* @Entity annotation is sufficient to make an java pojo map to database and if no table is created for that entity hibernate creates all
  database schema on its on to persist the pojo values.
* @Temporal is used to define whether for a date field we want to save date or time using "TemporalType.Date or TemporalType.timestamp or TemporalType.Time".
* @Embedded is used ovefr an pojo that is embedded in another entity.
Example:-
@Entity
public class UserDetails{

 @Id
 @generatedValue(strategy=GenerationType.Auto)
 private int Number;
 @Embedded
 private Address add;
 
 
 gettert and setters
 
}

@Embedable
public class Address{
	its member var and gettert and setters
}

* SessionFatory in hibernate is always singelton to avoid performance load on server.
* Code to get SessionFactory=new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory().
* Primary keys are of two types:- Serogate key(Key which has no business value) or natural key(which has business value).
