*Cloud computing is nothing but an architecture design where you want to seperate the physical server hardware, operating system,applications from each other.
*Using cloud computing when one of the instance of the application is down you can seamlessly tranfer the entire OS from one server to another.
*Some of the major components of cloud computing are:-
	*Virtualization.
*Virtualization is nothing but the technique of seperatig the OS from the hardware. SO thi smeans that if our OS is installed on server1 and for some reasons
their is a power failure or server crashes one can copu and paste the OS from server1 to server2.
*To achieve virtualization we use Hypervisors.
*Hypervisors are softwares that are installed on hardware and than one can install multiple OS on it using a "Management software".
	*Best example for that is VMWare. VMware hypervisour free of cost is ESXI.
	*Once we install ESXI on an physical hardware it gives us a plain blank screen with ip and computer name.
	*Now using VMware management software called "VSphere" we manage all the servers that are having ESXI installed 
	 on them and can manage my servers.
