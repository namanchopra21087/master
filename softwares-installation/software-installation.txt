13) Angular environment setup requires nodes js, angular cli to start the project. Refer:- angular tutorial for more at https://angular.io/
	Steps to set up angular:-
	* Install visual studio code as IDE for angular development.
	* C:\Users\NAMAN CHOPRA\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\bin is the default path for installing visual studio code.
	* Setup the installation ditrectory of visual studio code inside Path variable of environment variables.
	* Install latest version of node.js for building angular and using angular specific syntax.
	* Visual studio code can be opened from git bash using command "code ..". Only need to make sure that its installation directory is set in path.
	* Now open the angular project in Visual studio code.
	* now to isntall angular cli use command "npm install -g @angular/cli".
	* now you are all set to use angular sytax. 
	* For building the angular project and launching the project inside angular live development server use command "ng serve --open".
14) Postman to run rest api environment end points.
15) Use Robo-Mongo or Robo-3T as mongoDb client for querying the results of mongo db.
16) Lombok api for removing boiler-plate code.
17) Grafana with Prometheus should be used for monitoring of code.Its a analytical tool to simplify data in flow charts and diagram.
	*Prometheus is used as a plugin with spring-actuator to monitor code meterics.
	*Then prometheus service pulls these logs and acts as a datasource to 
		pass it to Grafana for making metrics charts.
18) JHipster is a consolidated software which can build a base framework in 20 minutes.
19) OAuth is used for authorization and authentication of the application.
	*Authentication is the process of verifying who you are by giving ur username and paswrod.
	*Authorization is the process of verifying what you have access to.DOne by checking ur roles.
20) Open LDAP is used for authentication and authorization of user credentails.

	*We create Users,Groups and Roles inside Open Ldap.
	*Use Apache Directory Studio to connect to LDAP Server.
21) Kubernetes
    *Alike EC2 its another container for deploying and running applications. 
	*Simply put, Kubernetes is a system for running many different containers for multiple different machines.
	*It was originally created by Google and donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). 
	*Kubernetes is generally used when you require a large number of different containers with different images. 
22) CUBA framework
	* Build on top of intellij.
	* IDE for java platform.
	* Provides the studio for designitslint -c ng java enterprise application.
	* Its an abstraction to low level java code.
	* Helps to create database entities with db scripts.
	* Can create GUI for backend entities using default cuba templates.
23) In maven dependency make sure to inherit the spring-boot-parent in ur own pom so that it can be generalized across the project.
24) Spring profiles used to config different configuration in different environments.
	* Spring profile can be enabled by using "spring.profiles.active=<profile name>" inside application.properties.
	* Now make application-dev.properties or application-prod.properties to enable specific profile.
	
25) TSlint is used to find angular typescript bugs.
	* TSLint.json can be used to validate the angular front end code.
	* use command npm install -g tslint.
	* then type tslint.json 'src/**/*.ts' to get the list of all the issues.
	* TsLint to be used is attached in gitrepo but normally each angular project has default tslint file.
